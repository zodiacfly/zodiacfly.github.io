This is my first blog on Github

I have been self-learning front-end web developing since sep/2018, and so far so good.
I don't have any coding and IT related experience before, I am a compeleted new guy here.
Github is very good place to improve, to learn, to communicate and to motivate myself.
I have a long way to go, and I will stick with here to see how actually far I can go!!
